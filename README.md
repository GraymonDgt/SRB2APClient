# SRB2APClient
The APworld, client, and mod files to be used with Archipelago randomizer

Avoid mentioning/ linking this on the main AP Discord because of the "no fangames" rule.
All discussion/ development of this APworld will take place here:

The APworld installs a client into the Archipelago launcher and launches the game upon connecting.
Place ArchipelagoSRB2.pk3 into your SRB2 addons folder to have the mod loaded upon connecting.
